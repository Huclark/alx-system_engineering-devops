## About
In this project, I learn more about bash scripting by implementing loops, conditions and parsing in scripts.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- How to create SSH keys
- What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
- How to use while, until and for loops
- How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
- How to use the cut command
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Requirements
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.7.0`) without any error
- **Executable Files**: All your Bash script files must be executable
- **awk**: You are not allowed to use `awk`
- **Documentation Standards**: The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

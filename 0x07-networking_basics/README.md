## About

This is a solution to the [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) project on Regular Expressions.

## Overview

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project I am expected to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:

#### OSI Model

- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

#### What is a LAN

- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

#### What is a WAN

- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

#### What is the internet

- What is an IP address
- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

#### TCP/UDP

- What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
- What is a port
- Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

### Requirements

- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.7.0`) without any error
- **Executable Files**: All your Bash script files must be executable
- **Documentation Standards**: The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## My process

### Built with

- Bash scripts
- Unix commands

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## About
In this project, I go through the concepts of Processes and Signals in a computer's operating systems. I learn how to find a process's PID to enable me manipulate the process by terminating (`kill`) and more.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a PID
- What is a process
- How to find a processâ€™ PID
- How to kill a process
- What is a signal
- What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

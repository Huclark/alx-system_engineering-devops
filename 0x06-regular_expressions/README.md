- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Executable Files**: All your Bash script files must be executable
- **Oniguruma Library**: All your regex must be built for the Oniguruma library

## My process

### Built with

- Ruby scripts
- Unix commands

### What I learned

This project enhance my understanding on what regular expressions are and how to implement some expressions like

```ruby
\d # to match any digit
{m,n} # to match m to n repitions
^...$ # to match lines that start with a specific character and end with a specific character
* # zero or more repetitions
+ # one or more repetitions
? # optional character
```

### Useful resources

- [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) - This helped me to learn Regular Expressions with simple and interactive exercises. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
